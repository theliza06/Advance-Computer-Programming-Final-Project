# I. PROJECT OVERVIEW
<p align="justify">
The Hiraya Hospital Appointments is a system that has a streamline and it simplify the process of scheduling, managing, and tracking patient appointments. It addresses the inefficiencies, delays, and errors often associated with manual or fragmented appointment management processes. With this system the secretary didn’t have to worry and will not be difficult in putting an appointment of each patients. I did this system because I encounter in the clinic that the secretary used a notebook in arranging or putting all the patients infromation, for me it is difficult to know or to arrange those appointments in that day and also we cant prevent the advance appointment/s and it has a chance that the information can be ramble. Also to have a access of doctor of the patient information or what appointment they booked.

The hospital appointment system is designed to streamline the scheduling and management of patient appointments, focusing on improving efficiency for secretaries and doctors. The system allows secretaries to input patient information and schedule appointments based on the availability of doctors, eliminating the need for patients to interact directly with the system. Secretaries can manage the entire appointment lifecycle, including booking, rescheduling, or canceling appointments, while ensuring real-time updates on doctors' schedules. Doctors can access their schedules, view appointment details, and plan their time effectively. The system includes core features such as appointment scheduling, doctor availability management, automated reminders for secretaries, and a dashboard for easy oversight of daily schedules. However, the system excludes features like direct patient access, medical diagnosis, virtual consultations, or integration with billing and insurance processing. It also does not handle pharmacy services or in-depth staff management. This system is specifically tailored for secretaries and doctors, ensuring a seamless flow of information and efficient appointment coordination, thus contributing to the hospital’s goal of providing organized and timely care.
<p align="justify">
The hospital appointment system project aims to achieve clear and measurable outcomes using the SMART criteria. Specifically, the system will streamline the scheduling process by enabling secretaries to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments accurately and efficiently based on doctor availability. The project aims to reduce scheduling errors by 90% and achieve a 95% appointment adherence rate, minimizing no-shows within six months of implementation. It is achievable by providing a comprehensive onboarding program, ensuring secretaries and doctors are trained to use the system effectively within four weeks of deployment. This initiative is highly relevant to the hospital’s mission of enhancing coordination between secretaries and doctors, leading to improved patient care and optimized resource utilization. The project will be fully deployed and integrated into hospital operations within three months from its start, with performance metrics reviewed quarterly to ensure continued success.

# II. PYTHON CONCEPTS AND LIBRARIES

## Python Concepts
### Functions and Modules   
  * Modularize the code by creating reusable functions and modules for managing appointments, cancellations, and rescheduling.


### Error Handling
  * Handle invalid inputs or conflicting appointment times using try and except.

## Python Libraries

### Python Tkinter

Tkinter is a Python library that can be used to construct basic graphical user interface (GUI) applications. In Python, it is the most widely used module for GUI applications. Tkinter can be used to create windows and dialog boxes that allow users to interact with your program. These can be used to display information, gather input, or present options to the user.

### MySql / SQLite3

It enables the python programs to access MySQL databases. It help data managers perform complex calculations and dta manipulation with ease. They can edit rows and tables, alter strings, and help you manage organized and easy-to-navigate databases.
SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It is a reliable connectivity solution for accessing the SQLite database from Python applications to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on data. 

### DateTime

The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times. It manages the date and time of the patients appointments.

### Tkcalendar

It is a python module that provides the Calendar and DateEntry widgets for Tkinter. The calendar widget display where the secretary will not be difficult in typing the date, but just click thedesire date that the patient appoint in the widget.

### Imagetk/PhotoImage

In Tkinter, ImageTk and PhotoImage are classes used for working with images. They are part of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) or its fork, Pillow, which integrates seamlessly with Tkinter to handle and display images in graphical user interfaces.

# III. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

### Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being
  * Ensures timely access to healthcare services by streamlining appointment scheduling. Reduces patient wait times and enhances overall
satisfaction, promoting better health outcomes. Minimizes missed appointments, ensuring optimal utilization of healthcare resources.

### Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
  * Implements innovative digital solutions to improve the operational efficiency of healthcare systems. Supports the creation of robust healthcare infrastructure by integrating digital tools for scheduling and resource management.

### Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities
  * Simplifies access to healthcare services, reducing barriers for individuals in underserved or remote areas (when integrated with telemedicine). Ensures equitable distribution of appointment slots and healthcare resources among patients.

### Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
  * Optimizes the use of hospital resources, such as staff time and facilities, by minimizing overbooking or underutilization. Reduces the need for paper-based appointment systems, contributing to environmental sustainability.

# IV. PROGRAM/SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
  * Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer. In VS Code, click on File > Open Folder (or Open for a single file). Navigate to the folder that contains your Python file(s) and database files, then select the folder.

### Step 2: Install DB Browser for SQLite
  * Download and install DB Browser for SQLite from its official website. This tool allows you to view, edit, and manage SQLite databases.

### Step 3: Open the SQLite Database in DB Browser
  * Launch DB Browser for SQLite. Click Open Database and navigate to the folder where your .sqlite or .db file is located. Open the database file to inspect tables, data, and structure.
    
### Step 4: Run the Python Code
  * Open the terminal in VS Code. Observe the output in the terminal to ensure the program runs successfully. If the program interacts with the database, check the database in DB Browser to see if the data has been updated as expected.
